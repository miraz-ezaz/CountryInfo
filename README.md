## Authentication & Security

### Login Page

Go to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/login/

### Secured Web Interface

The country list and detail pages are **only accessible after login**:

* Country list: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/countries/`
* Country detail (example): `http://127.0.0.1:8000/countries/34/`

Unauthenticated users will be redirected to the login page.

---

### Secured API Endpoints

All API endpoints require authentication.

You can test them using:

* Django session cookies (after login)

---

## REST API Documentation

All API endpoints are prefixed with `/api/` and are **protected by authentication**. You must be logged in to access them.

### Authentication Required

* Before accessing the APIs, log in at:
  `http://127.0.0.1:8000/login/`

* Then test authenticated routes using browser.
